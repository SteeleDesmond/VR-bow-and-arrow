# VR Bow and Arrow

The goal of this project was to learn the fundamental tools required to design a VR game. The scope of this project was to create a functional bow and arrow in VR. This game is compatible on most VR platforms including the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Valve Knuckles. Button mapping is available via the JSON files in the root directory of the project.

This project uses OculusSDK, OVR, and SteamVR. Many packages were downloaded under open license from the Unity Asset Store.
## Features
* Fully functional bow and arrow model and spawning system
* VR movement, teleportation, and level loading systems
* Functioning Player system with hand models
* Custom bow and arrow model created in Blender

## Bugs

* The fire particle systems in the forest scene are inefficient.
* The explosive particle system in the range scene will continue triggering every 4 seconds after it is hit.
* Some of the archery targets move unnaturally when hit with an arrow.

## Further Improvements
* Add additional bow models with different firing ranges and sound effects
* Add additional arrow particle effects with new arrow models
* Add a VR UI that includes information for the player like tips and stats
* Add a point system for hitting targets
* Design a target spawning system so that targets spawn and move
